# EMG-decomposition
Methods for detecting and classifying the motor unit (MU) firings from distinct MUs for EMG data recorded from indwelling electrodes.  
This process is known as MU decomposition.  In this project, concentrate on the classification stage of this process. 
In particular, I have developed a classifier using the technique of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. 
My project will be to develop clustering code, and then evaluate my codes on real EMG data.
